![Oak Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OutOfTheVoid/OakC/master/OakLogoSmall.png) Oak Programming Language Compiler
==========================================================================================================================

A reference compiler for the oak programming language, a practical, low level programming language inspired by C, C++, Rust, and HaXe.

The compiler is written in C++, and should eventually be fully documented.

See TODO.txt for an overview of the current state of the project, and please shoot me an email if you have any questions!
